THE PIXEL GATE — this is the hard constraint on all of this work. The user's
requirement is literally "1:1 100% exact": no change to visuals, no change to UX.
An optimization that is 20% faster and changes one pixel is a FAILED optimization
and must be reverted.

How to check, every single time, before you claim anything:

  cd ${ROOT}
  OW_NO_HMR=1 node tools/baseline.mjs --out=/tmp/<you>-before --port=<YOUR_PORT>
  # ... make your change ...
  OW_NO_HMR=1 node tools/baseline.mjs --out=/tmp/<you>-after  --port=<YOUR_PORT>
  node tools/imagediff.mjs --a=/tmp/<you>-before --b=/tmp/<you>-after

It must report "identical: true". Not "close". Not "withinEpsilon". IDENTICAL.
tools/baseline.mjs isolates each shot in its own page, which is what makes the
comparison bit-reproducible — do NOT substitute tools/shotset.mjs, which shares one
page across shots and drifts.

If your change fails the gate, you have two options and no others:
  1. Find the reason it changed pixels and eliminate it, then re-verify.
  2. Revert the change and report it as not-viable with the reason.
Never rationalize a diff as "imperceptible". Report it.

const PERF = `
HOW TO MEASURE — a median frame time is worthless here; the complaint is stalls.

  node tools/profile.mjs --port=<YOUR_PORT> --dpr=2 --frames=900

This drives real gameplay (moving camera, firing, AI active) at Retina device pixel
ratio, and reports the frame-time distribution plus every hitch with the per-frame
WebGL program-count delta that caused it.

Established baseline on an Apple silicon laptop at 1512x982 DPR 2 (internal 2268x1473 = 3.34 MP):
  fps p50 52-58, p95 37-51, p99 33-46  (measured BEFORE the visual repair passes)
  NOTE: triangle count has since roughly DOUBLED, 5.9M -> 11.2M, and draw calls rose
  to ~1583, because the surface/dressing pass added geometry. Re-measure the baseline
  yourself before optimizing; the numbers above are a floor, not current truth.
  worst frame ~300 ms with a warm shader cache, 3.1-3.9 SECONDS with a cold one
  86-146 WebGL programs compiled during play, up to 30 on a single frame
  heap growth 0 MB (not a leak), geometry/texture counts flat (not streaming)

TARGET: p99 >= 60 fps and no frame above 30 ms, at that resolution, with the pixel
gate passing. Run the profiler at least 3 times and report the spread — single runs
of this profiler vary a lot and have already produced one misleading conclusion.

  DIRS_WITH_CLOCK.map((dir, i) => () =>
    agent(
      `You are fixing a determinism bug in src/${dir}/ of the FPS at ${ROOT}.

THE BUG — visual output depends on wall-clock time. Subsystems call
performance.now() (or otherwise read real time) to drive animation, instead of using
the engine clock in ctx.time. Consequence, measured: any change to boot duration or
frame pacing shifts rendered output. When a 1.4 s shader pre-warm was added, the
pixel gate reported mean channel deltas of ~1/255 on static shots and 2.6-3.9 on the
transient-heavy 'impacts' and 'muzzle' shots. That makes it IMPOSSIBLE to prove any
performance optimization is visually neutral, which blocks all the perf work behind
this phase.

YOUR JOB — in src/${dir}/ ONLY:
1. Find every read of wall-clock time used for anything that affects rendering,
   simulation or animation: performance.now(), Date.now(), new Date(), implicit
   timing from setTimeout/setInterval driving visual state, and any accumulator
   seeded from real time.
2. Route each one through the engine clock instead: ctx.time.elapsed (scaled
   seconds), ctx.time.raw, ctx.time.frame, or the dt/h handed to update/fixedUpdate.
   Read ${ROOT}/src/core/engine.js and ${ROOT}/src/core/config.js first.
3. LEAVE ALONE genuine instrumentation — a performance.now() pair used only to log
   how long an init step took does not affect output. Do not churn those. Report
   which ones you deliberately left and why.
4. Any randomness must come from ctx.rng, never Math.random(). Fix violations.

CONSTRAINT: this must not change the rendered image. It changes WHERE time comes
from, not what is drawn. Same frame index must produce the same pixels.

You may edit any file. Do this:
1. npx vite build — fix until clean.
2. Confirm the harness is still self-consistent (this must hold or nothing else
   is measurable):
     OW_NO_HMR=1 node tools/baseline.mjs --out=/tmp/v-a --port=5320
     OW_NO_HMR=1 node tools/baseline.mjs --out=/tmp/v-b --port=5320
     node tools/imagediff.mjs --a=/tmp/v-a --b=/tmp/v-b       # must be identical
3. THE REAL TEST — pre-warm burns ~1.4 s of wall clock before the frame loop. If
   the determinism fix worked, enabling it can no longer shift a single pixel:
     OW_NO_HMR=1 node tools/baseline.mjs --out=/tmp/v-off --port=5320 --query=prewarm=0
     OW_NO_HMR=1 node tools/baseline.mjs --out=/tmp/v-on  --port=5320 --query=prewarm=1
     node tools/imagediff.mjs --a=/tmp/v-off --b=/tmp/v-on
   Before the fix this reported ~78-88% of pixels changed, mean delta up to 3.9.
   It must now report identical: true.
4. If step 3 still fails, hunt the remaining wall-clock dependency yourself and fix
   it. Report exactly which file and line was responsible — that is the single most
   valuable output of this phase.
5. CAPTURE THE CANONICAL BASELINE that every optimization will be judged against:
     rm -rf ${ROOT}/shots/perf-base
     OW_NO_HMR=1 node tools/baseline.mjs --out=${ROOT}/shots/perf-base --port=5320
   This is the reference image set. Everything after this must match it exactly.
6. Once step 3 passes, flip pre-warm ON by default in src/main.js (it is currently
   gated behind ?prewarm=1) and re-run step 3's comparison inverted to confirm the
   default path is the verified one.

Report honestly. If the gate cannot be made to pass, say so plainly — a false pass
here invalidates every optimization in the next phase.`,

- Cull casters per cascade by testing caster world-bounds against each cascade's

- Skip cascades that contain nothing this frame.
- Reuse the depth prepass to avoid redundant vertex work where possible.
- Audit the post chain for redundant full-screen passes and render-target
  ping-pongs that can be merged into one shader without changing output.
- Cut shader PERMUTATION count: fewer unique programs means less compile stall.
  Look for onBeforeCompile injections that create near-duplicate programs which
  could share one program with a uniform branch — but only where the compiler
  cannot already fold it, and only if output is bit-identical.
